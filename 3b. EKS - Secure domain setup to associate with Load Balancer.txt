Go to AWS Console -> Route 53 -> Registered domains -> Register domain

Search for a name and choose the name you need. I chose tekedify.net. I did not enable auto-renew after 1 year.

You will be asked to provide contact info.

Go to the "Requests" page and complete the payment.


====================


Go to AWS Console -> Certificate Manager -> Request Certificate

Provide the domain name for which you need the certificate -> *.tekedify.net (wild-card to make sure all sub-domains also have the certificate associated with them)

This will be in Pending Validation State. You need to "Create Records in Route 53" to complete the DNS validation. 

In Route 53 -> Hosted Zones -> Your domain -> you will see a new CNAME record added.

The CNAME of the Certificate ID in Certificate Manager will be added as a CNAME record in Route 53 -> Hosted Zones of the domain we created.

This is where association between SSL certificate and domain name happens.

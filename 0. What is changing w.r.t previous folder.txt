We are organizing the apps / deployments / services in separate folders.
This is useful when each app can have multiple paths / rules.
This will also help in developing / maintaining different apps separately by separate teams.

Note that, in each app, the name of the ingress resource file must be different and the name of each ingress resource must also be different.
But all of these ingress resources belong to the same "Ingress Group" and are tagged to the same Load Balancer.

Also, we are providing a name for the load balancer.
